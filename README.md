# Java patterns

This repository is meant as a deliberate practice playground for different patterns that appear in programming problems.

These exercises are meant to keep my skills sharp by:

- reinforcing understanding of patterns I commonly use or encounter
- familiarize with patterns I rarely interact with in my day-to-day.

Things I practice:
- OOP design patterns and principles
- Functional patterns
- Concurrency patterns
